### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub

âš¡ I'm Oz, a Stats student with aspirations in the data field. 

ðŸŒ± My interests in the field lie in analytical and predictive applications of data, and insight deduction through ML, which I plan to pursue as a career.
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on small-scale data modelling projects while learning about deep-learning tools and applications.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with... most things! Always open to suggestions with my code.
